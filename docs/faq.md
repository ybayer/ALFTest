# FAQ

<section class="module">
Adobe® PhoneGap™ Build is in beta, which means we’re getting lots of new questions all the time. We’ll be adding to this FAQ regularly, so if you have questions that need answering, [please ask us](http://community.phonegap.com).

## What does PhoneGap Build cost?
PhoneGap Build is currently in beta, so it’s free, and the service will remain free for open source projects. We’ll be announcing pricing details for commercial applications as we get closer to public launch.

<section class="module">
## How do I get started with PhoneGap Build?
Simply upload your web assets - a ZIP file of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, or a single index.html file - to PhoneGap Build, point us to your Git or SVN repository, or let us set up a git remote endpoint that you can push to. Then we’ll undertake the compilation and packaging for you. In minutes, you’ll receive the download URLs for all mobile platforms.

## Do I need to install anything before I use PhoneGap Build?
No!

<section class="module">
## What about developer accounts and SDKs? Do I need to set those up before starting with PhoneGap Build?
No! But you might want to install some of the SDK emulators if you don’t own a particular device that you want to test a build for.

## What do I do with my app when I get it back from PhoneGap Build? Is it ready for app store submission?
It depends on the platform that you're targeting. For the webOS and Symbian platforms, you will get back a binary that is ready for submission and distribution. For Android, iOS, and BlackBerry, you'll need to provide the correct certificates and/or signing keys to allow distribution. See our other documentation for more details on this process.

## What's on the PhoneGap Build roadmap?
Our first post launch priority is providing PhoneGap Build as a web service so you can seamlessly integrate with your existing technology infrastructure and tools.

</section>
<section class="module">
## Can I integrate PhoneGap Build with my existing tools?
Yes! we now have an [API available](/docs/api) you can use over HTTPS to build apps, and access data about your existing apps.

</section>
<section class="module">
## Can I use PhoneGap Build with a private Github repository?
We're currently working on integration with GitHub's API to allow access to your private repositories. We have a legacy service for pushing directly to PhoneGap Build that is still available through our API, but use for new apps is highly discouraged.

For the moment, we recommend uploading a zip snapshot of your repository contents when building a private app.

<section class="module">
## Can I build for iPhone?
Yes! Check out our [iOS Guide](/docs/ios-builds) for information on how to get PhoneGap Build up and running with iOS.

</section>
<section class="module">
## What are public apps?
Public apps are apps that, once built, can be downloaded by anyone who visits their page. The links and/or QR codes can be freely distributed to anybody you want to have access to your apps.

If an app is public, that does not mean your source code is available; that said, it is relatively easy to extract the source from a built PhoneGap app.

Private apps, by contrast, can only be downloaded by their owner, or by others that the owner has explicitly given permission to.
